trial_descript: Training of 2D Chebyshev polynomial-based model
# If trial_name == 'None', then name to the experiment is given automatically,
# otherwise it is set name set by user 
# trial_name: None
trial_name: test
# Simulation parameters
# Number of parameters per power dimension. For single-dimensional model it equals 1
pow_param_num: 10
# Chebyshev polynomal order
param_num: 22
# Model is parallel Chebyshev polynomials, summed at the output
# Each polynomail is fed by the signals x_n, delayd by delay
# from the range [-delay_num, delay_num].
delay_num: 4
batch_size: 1
# chunk_num is important parameter, which allows to divide whole signal
# into chunk_num blocks. LS method is implemented to accumulate 
# hessian and gradient along the whole signal length and save GPU memory.
# Increase this parameter if you obtain out of memory error.
